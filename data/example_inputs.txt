I usually skip breakfast but love spicy Indian food. I prefer direct, casual emails and work late nights.
I'm very health-conscious, go on runs every morning, and only work weekdays. I dislike spicy food.
I enjoy working remotely and feel more productive late at night. I prefer voice calls over texting.
I always eat breakfast. I like formal communication and never work after 6 PM.
